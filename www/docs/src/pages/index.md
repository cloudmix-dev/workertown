Workertown is a suite of packages to deploy fully featured, production ready

Each Workertown package provides a REST API, deployable to edge runtimes. They
are all highly configurable when needed, but come with "batteries included",
sensible defaults to make getting started a breeze.

## Why

At Cloudmix, we're firm believers that getting to production should be frequent,
easy and understandable - unhindered by hosting constraints, budget constraints
or time constraints. So, we've built a suite of packages that do just that -
provide a way to quickly deploy solutions for common architectural requirements.

All compatible with the edge.

## Quick start

It's very easy to get started with Workertown.

### Installing a package

All the Workertown packages are available to download via `npm`. They are all
namespaced under `@workertown/*`. For example, to install the search package,
run:

```bash
npm install @workertown/search
```

### Creating a service

All Workertown service packages follow the same export pattern.

You can either import the default export:

```ts
import search from "@workertown/search";
```

...or the **named** export for the service:

```ts
import { search } from "@workertown/search";
```

...and then call the function to create the service:

```ts
const service = search();
```

...and that's it!

{% callout title="Check the docs!" %}
Each Workertown service has a comprehensive list of options that can be passed
when you create the service.

Read the docs for the service you're using to see what options are available.
